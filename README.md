Magnetic Planet 32

A remake of the game engine of the shareware-game Magnetic Planet by KIWI from 1996.
The game runs now on modern Windows, and supports translations and local (Hotseat) multiplayer gameplay. 

To play the game, get the files in mplanet32, and run the MPLANET32.EXE.
Note, the files from the original (including the old executeble MPLANET.EXE - a NE-Excutable for Windows 3.1) are still needed for the assets.

The subdirectory mplanet32 contains the new Executable (MPLANET32.EXE) and language files together with the old game.
The subdirectory src contains the source code to build the MPLANET32.EXE.
